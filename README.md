# GMA_h
A Generic Mage Arena "hack"
> I do not condone the use of cheats and cheating

Unlike Gorilla Tag modding, there isnt a way to check if the lobby is modded, so yes, technically this is a cheat. I only made it to practice Bepinex modding in other games. I will update this regularly.
# Disclaimer
This repo will not be maintained for long. I will attempt to make this a mod one day and the name will be changed from GMA_h to GMA_m (Generic Mage Arena Mod) <br>
I made this for me and my friends, not to use in public lobbies, since I am unfamilliar with the mage arena codebase, I do not know how to check whether or not the room is private. Once I do, this repo will be updated. <br>
To any Mage Arena affiliated person(s) this is not for public use, just for reference when making Mage Arena mods. <br>
To any Mage Arena developers please contact me if you would like the removal of this "cheat"
# Another disclaimer
This "cheat" was only tested in private lobbies, for other communities I make mods for / with, (Gorilla Tag, Peak, etc...) this is the only game I have "cheated" in. I have / had no intent to cheat in any of the games I mod. Again, I made this solely to practice.
